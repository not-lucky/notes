All of these can be nested btw.
Always try to look for element attributes.
They provide many functionality.
Be sure to check if they are deprecated or not.
mdn, devdocs and w3schools are really good documentation source.

`<h1></h1>`: Heading size upto 6.

`<br>`: Line break.

`<hr>`: horizontal
- size='int' noshade    ....... are the attributes.

``<center></center>``: center whatever inside of it

`<!--     some text
some more text, is multiline -->`: comment, wont be rendered by browser. Multiline.

`<i></i> and <em></em>`: em means more emphasis, i is just for visual distiction.
``<b></b> and <strong></strong>``: strong has more importance

`<p></p>`: new paragraph

`<ul></ul>, <ol></ol> and <li></li>`: unordered list, ordered list and list item.

`<img src='image.png' alt='what img is about'>`: well, this is self explainatory.

`<a href="link.com">what to display</a>`: for embed link.

`<table></table>, <tr></tr> and <td></td>`: creates table, tr is table row and td is table data.
